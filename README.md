**The all new Rise Notes, coming late 2023.**

**Rise Notes** gives new life to interfaces and features you are familiar with. We always try to make our apps beautiful while remaining functional and Rise Notes continues that philosiphy.

## Appearance & Design

We use WinUI 2.6/2.7 to keep our user interface, clean, modern and consistent with Windows 11 UX. Although, this app does work on Windows 10 too. We use all of your favourite materials: Mica and Acrylic. Icons are the same ones used as those in Windows 11 and our icon tries to remain harmonious. We aim to look as native as possible. You can see what we're working on below:

## Downloads, Contribute and the Insider Program

MSIX packages are available now for the Pre-Alpha 1 build. You can try them by joining the Insider Program! We aren't going to be available in the Microsoft Store for the Pre-Alpha process as we will be releasing many builds over the next few months. Trying to approve each build on a regular basis is just not feasible. 

If you'd like early packages before they're available, join the **Rise** Insider Program. Like to contribute code or translate the app? Click the contribute button! And, if you're already an insider, you can leave the program or change your channel from Insider Settings.

**If you are an Insider already, just click the Download button and you'll be taken to a page to download :)**
